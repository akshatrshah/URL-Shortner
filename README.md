## URL-Shortner - Simple URL shortener

Hi! We are Group 16 and we bring to you the new URL Shortner. While Group-5 did a tremendous job starting with this project, we wanted to add new features to make it even better. 

We enhanced the UI and we enhanced the user experience!
We added a feature to login/signup and create your own URLs! That's right now own those URLs garunteeing management of your URL is safe and cannot be updated by anyone else.
We know why you use a URL shortner, you need to share links and you need to see how your customers are doing. We added some analytics to show how much your customers are user links!
Last but none of the least, you do not want to use the boring URLs that URL Shortner gives you? We bring to you the custom url feature!
You can create Custom Short Urls of your choice! Designed by you!

Wondering why the Shortner is misspelled? Thats because this project is all about making it short, simple and easy to share.
URL-Shortner aims to be the easiest ad-free url shortener that can be used to quickly generate sharable short urls.

- Ever typed out a long url on your phone only to see that you missed a '/' or misspelled a word?

- Have you shared multiple URLs with others because you sent an incorrect URL earlier?

- Had to update the same document every year but with updated URL, wondering if there was a way to keep the URL the same and just redirect to new one every year?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then this is going to bring a smile to your face!
The URL-Shortner is a simple tool that you can utilize to create short versions of that long urls and share it with others. Additionally, its just a few clicks to update an existing URL if you made a mistake or the URL has changes over time. If you don't need it anymore, simply go ahead and delete that.
